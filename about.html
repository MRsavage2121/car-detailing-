      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Titan Detailing</strong> was founded in <strong>2026</strong> by lifelong car and truck enthusiasts,

        We started with a simple goal: provide the highest level of detailing possible, 
        restoring vehicles to their showroom shine and protecting them for the long haul.
